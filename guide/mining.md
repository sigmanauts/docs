## Sigmanauts Mining Pool

### Overview
The Sigmanauts Mining Pool is a community-driven initiative to support the Ergo ecosystem through decentralized mining operations.

### Pool Details
- **Fee:** Minimal 0.9% 
- **Payout Threshold:** 0.5 ERG
- **Treasury Contribution:** Pool fees directly support the Sigmanauts DAO

### Why Mine with Sigmanauts?
1. **Support Decentralization:** Contribute to the security and decentralization of the Ergo network
