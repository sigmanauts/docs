# Introduction to Sigmanauts

## Our Philosophy

> "A narrative should be defined by its heart and not its borders. Things ought to be defined by prototype rather than by formula." - Inspired by Larry Wall

Ergo is more than just a blockchain—it's a community-driven project with a vision to transform how we think about economic tools and decentralized systems.

### The Heart of Sigmanauts

Ergo is a community project. While developers can write code that embodies certain values and the team can draft documents like [the Ergo Manifesto](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-04-26-the-ergo-manifesto/), the true essence of the project lies in how people interact, collaborate, and imagine new possibilities.

### Our Mission

The Sigmanaut program aims to:
- Empower community members to contribute their unique skills
- Foster an environment of creativity and innovation
- Build bridges between technology and real-world utility
- Create a supportive ecosystem that encourages experimentation

## Empowerment Through Collaboration

Empowerment isn't just about new tools—it's about discovering ways to use these tools that nobody has imagined before. Each Sigmanaut brings a unique perspective, skill set, and potential to transform the Ergo ecosystem.

### Key Principles

1. **Decentralization:** Not just in blockchain architecture, but in community participation
2. **Inclusivity:** Welcoming diverse perspectives and skills
3. **Continuous Learning:** Growing together and supporting each other's development
4. **Practical Innovation:** Finding real-world applications for blockchain technology

## Getting Involved

Whether you're a developer, artist, writer, marketer, or simply passionate about decentralized technologies, there's a place for you in the Sigmanauts community.
