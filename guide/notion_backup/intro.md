# What is a Sigmanaut?

> ‚Äú‚Ä¶a narrative should be defined by its heart and not its borders. Things ought to be defined by prototype rather than by formula. Who is a Sigmanaut? Who exactly is or isn't a member of the 'Ergo community'? These things are all defined by their centers, not by their peripheries.‚Äù  -[Larry Wall](https://interviews.slashdot.org/story/02/09/06/1343222/larry-wall-on-perl-religion-and), paraphrased
> 

Ergo is a community project. It is up to us to create the kind of community we want to be a part of. Alex Chepurnoy and the development team can write code that reflects certain values in how the blockchain works. The development team and larger community can write values into documents, as they have with [the Ergo Manifesto](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-04-26-the-ergo-manifesto/). But, this is just code and words. A heart is not defined by either. A heart gives life to the project, and it is what people do when interacting with each other that makes it beat.

The goal of the Sigmanaut program is to get you to think about the Ergo community, what would make it a great community to be part of, and to look for some small things you can do to help bring that kind of community into being. Throughout our lives, each of us has learned skills that can help grow the Ergo community. We can all contribute something we know to make the technology easier to use or make the experience of being in the community something that improves people's lives, even perhaps our own.

No one knows better than you what your skills are. No one knows better than you how you'd like to change or what you are willing to try that you've never tried doing before. Empowerment does not just spring from new tools. Empowerment comes from finding ways to use these tools to do things we, and the developers, never imagined possible. How can we help ourselves and others see new possibilities none were seen before?

Tapping into our creative energies and imagining new possibilities for ourselves is hard. It becomes easier when we are in a community where everyone is doing it. Sharing insights and getting help overcoming difficulties others have already faced can help speed our collective development. But transforming our own lives cannot be done with software. Software is a catalyst. True change is incremental. It is the work we do on ourselves with the help of the people around us.

Here, we can test out ideas and see what works. Given enough time, experimentation, and the right set of tools,¬†**we will build something transformative**. But, the blockchain isn't going to do it for us. In the end, change needs to be driven by people and the communities they are part of.

# First Steps

The easiest way to get started is to start where you are. What are you already doing? How did you come to be reading this document? Are there people you know in the community that are already working on an initiative, whether on their own or as part of Ergo Foundation that would like a hand?

Or maybe you are a big picture person and want to think about the larger landscape and what the community needs.

# The Ergo Manifesto Values

One way to start thinking about how the Ergo Community could be better and how you might contribute is to think about the values outlined in [The Ergo Manifesto](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-04-26-the-ergo-manifesto/):

[The Ergo Manifesto](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-04-26-the-ergo-manifesto/)

## Decentralized

When people think of decentralized, the first steps are to think about the decentralization of the blockchain network, either through¬†[setting up a node](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_12_02_how_to_setup/),¬†[mining in a small pool](https://enigmapool.com/)¬†with a single GPU card on your computer, etc. If you set up a node, other options become available such as running¬†[the Ergodex bots](https://docs.ergodex.io/docs/user-guides/advanced/setup-ergo-bots). Do you have the technical background and the desire to learn how to do these things?

If you don‚Äôt know how but are willing to try, perhaps there is someone who can help. But if you understand how, you can write up documentation to help others with little experience setting up a node and diversifying the network.

But, a more exciting and challenging question is how can we become more decentralized so that the community is more involved in helping each other use the chain, come up with new ideas, and ultimately improve the ecosystem.

## Open, Permissionless & Secure

How do you create a community that is open to an influx of new members and enable them to feel like they can contribute without waiting for someone to ask them? How do we create a secure environment that allows for many different viewpoints without silencing minority views? How do we create an infrastructure to help people help themselves and the community?

## Created for Regular People

Right now, cryptocurrencies are not used, nor are they designed for regular people. Of the eight billion people on the planet, only 34 million owned a cryptocurrency in 2021. At the beginning of 2022, China introduced the digital yuan to WeChat, a social network application with over a billion users.

How do these users get to the point where they understand seed phrases, send cryptocurrency to the correct blockchain, or ask for help when a decentralized application doesn‚Äôt work in the way they expect? What if they aren‚Äôt literate? What if they don‚Äôt speak english? Where‚Äôs the user manual in their language?

There‚Äôs an enormous learning curve when someone begins to use cryptocurrencies. How can that learning process be improved or more accessible for a regular person? What can we do to help get them there?

## A Platform for Contractual Money

At first blush, this might seem to be of interest to developers. But, the end portion of this section of the Ergo Manifesto states, ‚Äúmaximize the use and utility [of] contractual money.‚Äù This is an invitation to look at the tools we have, imagine the tools we might create, and come up with new ways to use the chain that might not have occurred to developers who aren‚Äôt going to use the blockchain in the same way as regular people or have different needs. 

## Long Term Focus

If we envision a future where eight billion people can use cryptocurrencies from their cell phones to enhance their economic lives, what will need to happen? Can we even imagine it? Perhaps you can.

</aside>

Once you've made your way through the training programme, and other sigmanauts have gotten a chance to know you - a vote will be held to determine whether you should advance to the Sigmanaut role. 

### Responsibilities

With great power, comes great responsibility. While it will be clear that Sigmanauts are community-driven, you will be a representative of the community. If anyone displays any deception, trolling, arguing, etc that goes outsides these bounds the existing officers may vote to strip you of this role. 

<aside>
üí∞ **Payment**

</aside>

The Ergo Foundation has funding for ecosystem growth providing there is a good value for the community. Please keep in mind that in the early stages of this programme, figuring what we have budget for is still a matter of debate. 

Tasks or roles that can be funded

1. Ambassador roles that support networks and bring people into the Ergo ecosystem. This can be hosting regular meet-ups,  running a regional or special interest community. 
2. The Contributors programme run by @Angie needs reliable, high quality writers and artists. We can also reward your medium articles based on views.  Please see the [Editorial](https://www.notion.so/Editorial-e16f5117fc01417fbe4269ce0b5a2905?pvs=21) section for more information.
3. Any existing bounties or grants featured in the [grow-ergo](https://github.com/ergoplatform/grow-ergo) repository. This includes educational content, developer bounties, grants and Zero-Knowledge Funds. 
4. Exceptional contributions (Trending social media post, resources and tooling that help the community can be rewarded on a case-by-case basis.
5. Translations for specific items (Manifesto, website) please see the [Editorial](https://www.notion.so/Editorial-e16f5117fc01417fbe4269ce0b5a2905?pvs=21) section for more information.

Note that this list is nowhere near complete, and as the first Cohort - you are the beta testers of this structure. 

Please use this [submission form](https://q9fwzopidh8.typeform.com/to/G5gAKC4r) to request payment for your contributions. Please start small if you are unsure if there is an existing bounty or task available, each submission will be approved on a case-by-case basis but if the value provided is worthwhile, we can recommend you dedicate more hours this task. [clockify.me](http://clockify.me) is a great way to track where and how you spent your time. 

<aside>
üîë **Access**

</aside>

With the ecosystem expanding rapidly, the core team can no longer effectively communicate with everyone by jumping into one of the chats occasionally. Sigmanauts gain exclusive access to the team, bringing ideas to the wider community and representing them while helping to shape Ergo going forward whether it be in any of your contributions in writing, campaigning, or shaping of the sigmanauts structure or Ergo itself.

# Code of Conduct

The Ergo community consists of people from all over the world and all walks of life who have come together to grow and safeguard the future of Ergo. All participants in the community are expected to act lawfully, honestly, ethically, and in the project's best interest. This Code of Conduct offers rules and guidelines designed to aid judgment within our community and keep it a clean and well-lighted place for civilised public discourse about the project. By joining and participating in any official Ergo community channels, you confirm that you agree to be bound by the Code of Conduct.

## **IMPROVE THE DISCUSSION**

Please help us make the community a welcoming place for discussion. The topics discussed in the community matter to us, and we want you to act as if they matter to you. Please be respectful of the topics and the people discussing them, even if you disagree with some of what is being said. One way to improve the discussion is by discovering ones that are already happening. Spend some time to search the community platform before replying, and you'll have a better chance of meeting others who share your interests. Always look to add value. 

Discussion should be healthy and informative, and members should provide a meaningful contribution towards the development of Ergo. Any content shared or uploaded online should be relevant to the community. Please also refrain from posting or spreading misinformation or fake news that attempt to create fear or doubt. We also do not allow trading or shilling of ERG or other tokens, goods or services.

### **BE AGREEABLE, EVEN WHEN YOU DISAGREE**

People often disagree. That's fine. But remember to¬†*criticise ideas, not people*. 

Please avoid
