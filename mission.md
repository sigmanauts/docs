# Mission Statement

## Who We Are

The Sigmanaut Program is an Ergo community group that advocates for the adoption of the Ergo blockchain while promoting Ergo’s values in the larger cryptocurrency space. Members volunteer their time, skills, and resources to deliver on the goals of the group and of the larger Ergonaut community.

## Vision

Sigmanauts spread awareness of the Ergo blockchain while promoting avenues and platforms that help foster an ecosystem where the project’s stewardship remains with the people in a decentralized and transparent manner, aligning with the values of the community and in-line with the first principles of decentralization as outlined in the Ergo Manifesto.

## Mission

We carry forward the mission of the Ergo Manifesto by fostering an ecosystem for, and accessible to, regular people through collaborative efforts in building and supporting freely-accessible avenues for community education, engaged participation, and leadership development.

+ Decentralization
+ Open-Source coding
+ Long-Term Focus & Adaptability
+ Education & Empowerment
+ Honesty & Transparency
+ Collaboration
+ Inclusivity
