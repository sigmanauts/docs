Sigmanauts Update | November 27, 2024

This week, the Sigmanauts welcomed two new Sig-Cans: Fitz and Geronimo. 

Geronimo has offered to help with front end development on the Sigmanauts mining pool, and is open to help with other development as well. 

The Sigmanauts have moved from the beta-Paideia DAO to mainnet Paideia. Reminder to all Sigs to un-stake in beta and re-stake over in mainnet Paideia.

qx() has successfully sent beta-Paideia treasury funds to mainnet Paideia.

The main treasury multi-sig will be transferrring all of the treasury funds to the new multisig address, which will be controlled by Luivatra, Cannonq, Marc the Shark, Jake the Snake, Grayman, CW, qx().

Wombo will be using Mew Fund to fund a campaign, trying to get more use cases for rsErg on Cardano. Please keep an eye on the upcoming Mew fund and contribute if you can. Details can be found here: https://fund.mewfinance.com/contribute and go to upcoming.

The Sigamanust DAO proposal to make supERGeometry a Sigmanaut is ACTIVE! supERGeometry is running Sigmanauts X profile, and is killing it! Sigmanauts please go vote here: https://app.paideia.im/sigmanauts/proposal/supergeometry-for-sigmanaut-86ce299e-b9dc-4c80-8eac-35c79e5ae617

Cannonq is looking for Sigs input on forming an entity for the DAO. He has all the info ready, and leaning towards Marshall Islands. Please contact him if you are interested in this subject.

The Sigs have setup a Bluesky account, please support over there if you can. Sigmanauts bsky: https://bsky.app/profile/sigmanauts.com Ergo Platform bsky: https://bsky.app/profile/ergoplatform.org

Sigmanauts.com has had some minor updates and improvements. Publication of the weekly Sigs meetings transcripts will resume, and last week's is available now. The miner lookup for the Sigmanauts mining pool has been moved to its own page, to simplify the mining page.
