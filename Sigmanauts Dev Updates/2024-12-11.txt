The Paideia discussion about changing the DAO config has been constructive, and Grayman will be working on the config update soon.

The second multi-sig for the Sigmanauts treasury has been formed. Waiting on the orginal multisig members to transfer everything over.

Grayman got a response back from Mojtaba Tefagh at Edinburgh University regarding running the node and associated services on their cloud servers. See pins in the Sigmanauts general chat to read the response.

Cannon has an update on forming the DAO in Marshall Islands. Price has increased, but "still best option for risk to individuals, etc. BUT not as low as earlier this year"

The community guidelines for Sigmanauts DAO document has been added to Sigmanauts website. See it here: https://sigmanauts.com/community-guidelines/
